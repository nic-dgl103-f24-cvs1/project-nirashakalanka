# Project Summary: Big Brisket Barbecue Website Redesign

**Chosen Site:** [Big Brisket Barbecue](https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com/)

## Why the Client Needs a New Website

### **Primary Purpose**

### **Target Audience**
- Local food lovers seeking high-quality barbecue.  
- Event planners looking for catering services.  
- Tourists searching for a great barbecue experience.  
- Families and groups wanting a casual dining environment.

### **Overall Message**
- Showcase the mouthwatering barbecue dishes and a welcoming atmosphere.  
- Communicate authenticity, quality, and a passion for barbecue.  
- Promote convenience with online ordering and catering options.

### **Call-to-Actions**
- Order online (primary goal).  
- View the menu.

- Learn about the restaurant's story and BBQ craft.

### **Why the Current Site is Inadequate**
- **Accessibility:** No clear alt-text for images; difficult for visually impaired users to navigate.  
- **Design:** Outdated and lacks a visual identity that aligns with the brand's quality and warmth.

## Look and Feel

### **Design Approach**
The design will be **warm, inviting, and flavorful,** reflecting the restaurant's brand identity and the hearty experience of enjoying authentic barbecue.

### **Mood**

- Bold and hearty.  
- Modern with touches of tradition.

### **Inspiration**

### **Proposed Color Scheme**
- **Primary:** Warm brown (`#bc7939`) to represent the smoky and hearty barbecue essence.  
- **Secondary:** Golden yellow (`#FFD54F`) to evoke the warmth of fire and the richness of BBQ sauces.  
- **Neutral:** Cream (`#fff2e6`) for a clean background that emphasizes food visuals.  
- **Highlight:** Charcoal gray (`#4E4E4E`) for modern and professional accents in text and CTAs.
